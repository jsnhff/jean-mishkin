Jean Mishkin has provided successful support to students applying for both internships and jobs with non-profit organizations, with government agencies, and with highly sought-after private sector firms.

Increasing numbers of undergraduate and graduate admissions committees look for applicants who have participated in high quality internships that are consistent with the student’s expressed academic or career aspirations.

Employers now routinely look for graduates who have had at least one, if not more, career-oriented internships or summer jobs and who can consequently hit the ground running once hired.

Jean Mishkin understands how competitive the application process is for these opportunities.

Your cover letter must motivate the hiring managers to turn the page and read your resumé.

Your resumé must motivate them to contact you to come in for an interview.

And after your interview, your thank you notes to the people with whom you spoke must remind them why they liked your credentials – and why they want to make you an offer.

Jean Mishkin will work with you word by word, sentence by sentence, paragraph by paragraph, to present a clear and compelling case for why you are the best candidate for the position.

Jean will help you to focus your resumé, to craft strong cover letters, and to write gracious, follow-up thank you notes.

Jean will work with you from start to finish – including that thank you note that you will send to the hiring manager once you receive your offer.
