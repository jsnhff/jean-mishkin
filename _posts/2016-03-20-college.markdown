Each year, admissions committees sort through GPAs, SAT and ACT scores, portfolios, lists of honors and awards and activities, and letters of recommendation trying to build a portrait of what each applicant is really like.

And each year, once the admissions officers have sorted through all the numbers and all the lists and letters, they complete their portrait of you by reading your essays.

They want to know why they should choose you.

They want you to tell them your story.

Jean Mishkin has spent decades helping students find and write their stories.

With Jean’s hands-on support, her clients have crafted well-written and creative essays that have gained them admission to a wide range of colleges and universities – large research universities, small liberal arts colleges, Ivy League schools, and specialized fine art and design colleges and programs:

“What should I write about?  I have nothing to say!”

Everyone who has gone to high school has a story to tell – and probably more than one!

Jean Mishkin starts at the beginning – she helps you choose essay topics by talking with you about the most important part of the essay – you!  By talking with you about your classes, your hobbies, the jobs you have had, the art you create, the sports you play, Jean will help you see that you have a lot to offer to a college admissions committee – and that choosing an essay topic is not as difficult as it may seem.

Jean will work with you from the first draft through to the final product  – no matter how many revisions it takes and no matter how many times you decide, “I’m starting over”.

Jean Mishkin will work with you word by word, sentence by sentence, paragraph by paragraph, to help you write your story in a compelling and creative way so that when the admissions committee reads it they will know who you really are and why you are a great fit for their school.
