The competition for post-graduate fellowships is fierce.

The numbers of applicants for these coveted positions continues to increase as the financial support available for them continues to decline.

The writing support that colleges and universities make available to students who are applying for fellowships is frequently quite limited as the need to work with large numbers of students simply does not permit the faculty to devote sufficient time to any one proposal or application.

Jean Mishkin has worked successfully with students applying for competitive fellowships, providing the focused and consistent editorial support that is needed to write successful proposals and applications.

Jean Mishkin will provide the seamless, detailed support that is required to produce a strong application â€“ working with you word by word, sentence by sentence, paragraph by paragraph.

From the earliest conceptual stages of developing your proposal through to copy editing the final product, Jean will provide you with continuous, specific feedback so that your writing process is focused and efficient and your proposal and application are strong entries in this highly competitive environment.
